  <h4>Dumb bell Kickback</h4>
</div>

<div id="description">

  <p>A good tricep exercise to focus on one arm at a time for fixing muscle irregularity
  and instability. Put one leg on the bench and the other straight on the ground. Take a low
  weight dumb bell and have your arm behind you parallel to the ground. Now lower the dumb bell
  so it is now at a 90 degree angle and then bring it back up.</p>

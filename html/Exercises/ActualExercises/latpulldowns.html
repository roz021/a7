  <h4>Lat Pulldowns</h4>

<div id="description">

  <p>This exercise works on your lats, the sides closest to your chest and full upper
  body. Grab the bar attached to the cable and grip as if it were a ladder rung but extended.
  Now firmly and in a controlled movement, pull down to your chest and keep your back tight
  and straight. This will result in your muscles activating and feeling a slight burn on the sides
  of your upper body.</p>

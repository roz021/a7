  <h4>Seated Overhead Press</h4>
</div>

<div id="description">

  <p>Similar to the military overhead press. Instead of standing, you sit down
  to take out you abs and reduce momentum. A good way to really isolate your shoulders
  and have increased stability. With dumb bells, it helps you fix instability and
  gets a good pump in.</p>

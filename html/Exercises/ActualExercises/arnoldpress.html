  <h4>Arnold Press</h4>

<div id="description">

  <p>A variation of the seated overhead press. This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's
  infamous variation where you assume the overhead press but keep your arms at a 90 degree
  angle first, you press, then bring it back to 90 degrees and bring your arms inwards and then
  back out and press again. It really gives your shoulders a burn while also working
  out a bit of your chest.</p>

  <h4>Seated Wrist Extensions</h4>

<div id="description">

  <p>Similar to seated wrist flexions, this time, make it so your palms are not facing
  you and instead, it is the back of your hand. Flex your wrists in an upward motion and this will
  focus on the top part of your forearms to grow.</p>

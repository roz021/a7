  <h4>Hammer Curls</h4>

<div id="description">

  <p>Imagine you're swinging a hammer. It is in front of you and you swing in a downward motion.
  Keep your elbows down perpendicular to the ground and tight. Now bring the dumbbell up and down in
  a controlled motion. This works out the peak of your bicep and gives it the "shape".</p>

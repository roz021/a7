  <h4>Barbell Back Squats</h4>

<div id="description">

  <p>This exercise will get your booty popping like no other while letting you get
  massive gains in strength and volume. Place the bar on your traps and point your toes
  in an outward angle. Now go down like you're sitting in a chair and then stop at a 90 degree
  angle. Then go back up and repeat. You will feel this is in your glutes and quads.</p>

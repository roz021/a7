  <p>Great for if you're a former rower and miss the sport! This exercise makes you keep tempo
  and also works out your upper back while making you sweat due to the continous motion of pulling and
  getting pulled back. It is a great way to slowly increase your heartrate while maintaining a tempo.</p>

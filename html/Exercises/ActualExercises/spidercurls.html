  <h4>Spider Curls</h4>

<div id="description">

  <p>Using an incline bench. Place your chest onto the bench itself and now that you're
  backwards, lift your dumbbell(s) and keep your arms perpendicular to the ground and curl as
  you would with a regular bicep curl. This is another variation to isolating the bicep and helps
  grow.</p>

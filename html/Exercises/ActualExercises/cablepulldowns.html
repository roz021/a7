  <p>Pulldowns really allow you to focus purely on triceps and hit's the small and big head
  of your triceps. It is what allow you to get that volume and definition with enough reps.
  Grab the cable and have it extended out in an upside down v position and pull down all the way.
  The trick is to keep your elbows pointed in a perpendicular motion and still while your hands and
  the rest of your arms moving back up. </p>

  <h4>Seated Calf Raises</h4>
</div>

<div id="description">

  <p>Using the seated calf raise machine, keep your upper body straight and your feet
  halfway planted on the foot rests. Now by taking off the safeguard, lift your legs up
  using your toes and go all the way up and down possible. This gives a full contraction and
  hits both your lower and upper calf heads.</p>

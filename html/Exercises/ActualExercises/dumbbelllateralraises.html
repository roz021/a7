  <h4>Dumb bell Lateral Raises</h4>
</div>

<div id="description">

  <p>A good exercise for targeting the big head of your shoulders. It is what helps
  give you broader shoulders. Grabbing a dumbbell, you can lift it up laterally and
  it will let you feel a burn along the long head and make you have those cannonball
  shoulders to let you carry people on your shoulders.</p>

  <p>A good finisher for triceps. Place your hand behind your back and onto the side of
  a bench, have your upper body straight and legs straight with the heels of your feet
  only touching the ground. Now slowly lower yourself with your arms and you will feel the burn
  when going down and back up. </p>

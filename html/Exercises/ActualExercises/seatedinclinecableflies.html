  <p>Place a chair/bench near a cable machine. Position and anchor the cables to where you are comfortable
  and sit in the chair and grab the handles (attached to the cables). Now pull in an inward
  motion that makes you compress your chest and has both handles touching. This is a good exercise for
  giving you that pump to make your chest look bigger.</p>

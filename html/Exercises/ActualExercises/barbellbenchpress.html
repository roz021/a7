  <h4>Barbell Bench Press</h4>

<div id="description">

  <p>A great way to gain strength as the barbell weights 20kg/45lbs. This difficult
  exercise is how to get your strength up when it comes to push movements and forces you to
  be stable while also maintaining form. Recommended for those who want to get their numbers up.
  You grab the barbell while you are seated lying face up on the bench and push off and let it come down
  and then push back up to complete one rep. </p>

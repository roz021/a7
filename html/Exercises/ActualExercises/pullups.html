  <p>Find a pullup bar and then grab it with your wrists facing away from your face.
  Make sure you have a slightly wider than shoulder length grip and squeeze your abs
  while concentrating your strength to lifting your body up with a tight grip on the bar.
  This exercise works out your upper back with your traps, abs, and rear delts being activated.</p>

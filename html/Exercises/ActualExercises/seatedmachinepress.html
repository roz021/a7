  <p>Find a seated machine press. This machine is similar to doing a barbell/dumb bell
  bench press. A good way to isolate one pec or both pecs at a time. It focuses on giving you more volume
  work than strength work. A good supplement for when you are done with working your strength workouts.</p>

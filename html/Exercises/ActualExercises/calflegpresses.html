  <h4>Calf Leg Presses</h4>
</div>

<div id="description">

  <p>Using a leg press machine, plant your feet halfway where your half your feet are on
  the platform. Now release the safeguards and slowly bring your knees in and push up with your toes.
  this is effective in taking out your upper body in the equation, making it a purely focused calf exercise.

  <h4>Standing Calf Raises</h4>
</div>

<div id="description">

  <p>With a pair of dumbbells, grip them to your sides and keeping your body stiff except for your
  legs, lift up your heels and keep your toes on the ground. This will result in a burn
  in your upper calf head. Good for growing your calves.</p>
